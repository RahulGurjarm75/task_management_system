   <br>
    We are thrown into the water constantly, having to learn life lessons all over again. 
    Sometimes you have to develop a complicated application in a short period of time or you have to develop a complicated algorithm.
    Perhaps you have to troubleshoot a bug you have never encountered before.
    The more challenges you meet, the more interesting they are, and they are also very rewarding once you overcome them.
    That can be difficult, but it can also be very interesting.
